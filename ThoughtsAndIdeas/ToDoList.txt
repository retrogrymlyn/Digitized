1. Create a Variable window with possible different sizes and custom resizing for the game

2. Main Menu for game. (talk to Kyle about this, this is a bigger project than you think, and he has an awesome idea for it. remember, this will
			be one of the first things people see.)

3. Options Menu. Display needs to behave like you are editing Command line Variables.

4. In Game Textures:
		Grass -
		Dirt
		Sand
		Mud
		SWAMP
			Lillypads
			Mucky?
			Aquatic Plants
			Aquatic Flowers
		Water
			Water Depth 1
			Water Depth 2
			Water Depth 3
			Water Depth 4
			Water Depth Inf

	Any others, put them on this list!


5. Texture Coding:
		Grass makes squish sound
		Dirt makes packing sound
		Sand makes squishy sound
		Mud makes moist squash sound
		Lilly Pads make Splash sound
		Aquatic Plants make splash sound
		Aquatic Flowers make splash sound
		Water makes different sound per the depth
		Water has multiple Levels... Need to talk about this one. (edit once confirmed)

6. Sprite Coding:
		This needs to be absolutely PERFECT. 
		No seriously. Be as OCD as possible.
	
		Movement needs to be precise and tight Super Meat Boy Esque.
		Need to be able to edit abilities and movement in game as per the PRC (Programmer Character)
		Need to be able to swim.
		Need to make sounds (i.e. hurt sounds, death sounds, Breathing from water sounds, emotion based sounds, etc.)
		
			
Add to this list when and if you want or need something done... Or change/subtract things if you finish parts of them
